Make the directory our chroot would be in and the bin folder.

    mkdir -p MyChroot/bin

Now, we need to download a shell. (For this example, use Ash from Busybox 1.26.)

    wget https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.26.2-i686/busybox_ASH -O MyChroot/bin/ash

Next, make the binary executable.

    chmod +x MyChroot/bin/ash

To run chroot do;

chroot path/to/<shell>
