Might need to do:
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox virtualbox-dkms
    sudo usermod -a -G disk $USER

Then Get Windows Partition info and drive letter


// Sudo seems to cause issues with below command and reg users then accessing it.
Then Insert Info from above to below:
    VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk \
    -filename "/path/to/win8.vmdk" -rawdisk /dev/sda \
    -partitions 1,4,5

Launch VBox and create an image but select the created VMDK.

Finally, have fun!!
