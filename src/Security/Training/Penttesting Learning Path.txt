Note:   This phase listing is based off of my programming background,
        what I did with Juice Shop, and Fedlearn classes.

Note 2:
        Free Time at Work phase covers stuff that doesn't fit nicely in the other phases.

Note 3: OWASP Juice Shop:  16% completed.
        ( Most of 1 stars, a quarter of 2 stars, one or two of the 3 stars, and one 5 or 6 stars )


Goals:
2-3 hours per weekend! (
                        1 hour per day of video then try and apply concepts.
                        Application happens either on the day of video or all on Sunday.
                        )

::  Phase1:  This phase is a broad rundown of things to look at when doing application hacking.  ::

This is the big picture section of what can be drilled down into. Most of the lessons will be structured to
fill these knowledge sets. I get a few introduction classes discussing broad topics and then a play by play
to see the concepts in action.

I then start off proper by getting an introduction into reconnaissance and footprinting the app, network, etc.
From there, pretty much after reconnaissance, it comes down to a wide array of potential threat vectors.
I cover the fundamentals with the below topics while re-enforcing what I studied from Fedlearn.
