::    Information Security Management    ::

--  (Security Principles)  --
[  CIA or Security Triad  ]

Confidentiality -->  Only authorized systems, processes, and individuals should have access when needed.
                Note:  Pretty straightforward but can affect integrity if not maintained...

  Integrity     -->  Information should be protected from intentional, unauthorized, or accidental changes.
                Note:  Deleted information is bad; but, what if we lose trust in the validity of that
                       information? Integrity isn't just protection against loss but destructive edits, etc.

 Availability   -->  That information should be available to authorized individuals when needed.
                Note:  Basically up time. Security is also assurance that one can have near 24/7
                access for authed users.
                       This is very important for timely processes such as billing,
                       business competition, governmental actions militarily or otherwise.

[  Governance  ]:       Leadership and oversight
[  Guidance  ]:         Policies, plans, standards, guidelines, and procedures
...geared around...
[  Risk Management  ]:  (paraphrased)  value/asset identification and risks against them.
...combined with...
[  Ethics  ]:           (paraphrased)  promotion of moral guidelines against amoral actions/actors
                        Note:  This is the- what is the red line concept? We can't ident. or protect
                        without knowing WHAT we need to prevent and detect against.
... which improves...
[  Org. Behavior  ]:    (paraphrased)  improves training, awareness, and org. structure to comply with
                        business goals and laws.




::    Risk Management    ::
(Penetration testing is just one tool of many to identify risks to the security of the org.)

[  Establish Risk Context  ]:  Environment in which decisions on risk are made. (Risk Management Strategy)

[  Assess Risks  ]:            (paraphrased)  Who, what, when, where, why (This looks at the org.'s over
                                                                           all posture and Risk Management
                                                                           Strategy)

[  Respond to Risks  ]:         Evaluating, developing, and implementing response to reduce/limit risk.

[  Monitor Risks  ]:            (paraphrased)  adapting to changes of threats or changes of value targets
                                to re-posture security and the aforementioned systems.


--  (Principles)  --
[  Avoidance  ]:     (paraphrased)  Don't do stupid shit that you know exposes oneself to threats.
                     IE, bad practices and policies

[  Transference  ]:  Sharing risk (often linked with insurance) is only part of the picture. *(legal responsibility is not transferred)
                     If using cloud, the responsibility is shared between you and the provider.

[  Mitigation  ]:    security controls, counter-measures, monitoring tools

[  Acceptance  ]:    willing to take the punch if loss occurs. Basically, not much of a defense or barely mitigateable.
                     Note: likelihood is low


::    Security Controls    :: (Establish boundaries)

--  Control Mechanisms  --
[  Detective  ]:    Discover when policies have been violated   (Intrusion detection system, IDS)
[  Preventive  ]:   Inhibit actions that violate policies    (firewalls)
[  Corrective  ]:   Use violations or exceptions to counteract the violation   (configuration management)
[  Deterrent  ]:    Discourage aberrant actions/violations    (User accounts)
[  Recovery  ]:     Flow control to normal state  (system backups)

--  Control Types  --
[  Administrative  ]:     define and manage access to information   (background checks)
[  Technical  ]:          logical controls in systems that determine access to info n' services   (patching systems and app)
[  Physical  ]:           mechanisms that protect access to physical spaces and devices.  (cameras)


--  Testing Controls  --
"Box" Testing

[  White Box  ]:  aka, Crystal box testing, has complete information about, and access to the system being tested.
                  (user accounts, admin access, documentation, source code, test suits and frameworks, test cases, algorithm descriptions, etc.)

[  Grey Box  ]:   some info is available but not complete
                  (source code but no user accounts or admin access. Api calls anyone??)

[  Black Box  ]:  no information or access. Purely blind except for what is publicly accessible.
                  (crafting inputs and observing responses)




::    Penetration Testing    ::

Determine effectiveness of real world attacks.
Determine the level of skill required.
Ident. needed security  controls.
Evaluate response to the attack.

--  Tools, Techniques, and Procedures  --

Exploit known vulnerabilities.
Find new vulnerabilities
Use existing tools
Create new tools
Social engineering

--  Colloquialisms and Terms  --

"Pen Test"    == Penetration testing
"Pen"         == Even shorter- "How is the pen going?"
"Red Team"    == From military and intelligence groups meaning "The attackers"
"Blue Team"   == The defenders
"Purple Team" == a combo of red n blue teams, in an exercise to test specific
                 controls and skill sets
