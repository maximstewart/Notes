::  Use of the PTES  ::

http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page




::  Pre-engagement Interactions  ::
[  Project scoping  ]:  Defining effort, size of tests, time of work, scope creep mitigation

[  Information Gathering  ]:  See module-3-image-1 in this dir. (Not exhaustive list)

[  Defining Goals  ]:  No dih side

[  Emergency Contacts  ]:  Systems could go down, vulnerability found, etc.
                           Get:  Full name, Title and operational responsibility,
                                 Authorization to discuss testing activities
                                 Two 24/7 contact numbers
                                 A method of secure information exchange


[  Rules of Engagement  ]:   HOW will things be tested? Time lines, locations, evidence handling,
                             status updates, testing times, permission to test documents, etc.




::  Intelligence Gathering  ::
Target selection
Identification and Naming
OSINT - Open Source Intelligence: See module-3-image-2 for more info in a broad
        setup / or look through documentation at the link above

Footprinting:  DNS, DHCP, BGP, Whois databases, and even packet sniffing




::  Threat Modeling  ::  (Included in report to client...)
Business Asset Analysis

[  Business Process Analysis  ]:   Technical infrastructure
                                   Information Assets
                                   Human Assets
                                   Third Party Integration

[  Threat Agents / Community Analysis  ]:  see module-3-image-3 image for quick rundown...

[  Threat Capability Analysis  ]:    Analyzing tools used buy threats, availability of tools and exploits,
                                     comms mechanisms, accessibility

[  Motivation Modeling  ]:     Money, fame/fun, hacktivism, grudge, nation state threats?




::  Vulnerability Analysis  ::
[  Active  ]:      Interaction with system (network scanners, app scanners,
                   protocol specific scanners, manual/direct scans)

[  Passive  ]:     Metadata analysis, traffic monitoring

[  Validation  ]:  Confirming results through correlation and manual testing. Attack trees and attack avenues

[  Research  ]:     Public knowledge/portals/vendors, exploit DBs, common passwords,
                    hardening guides for understanding weaknesses, disassembly and code analysis




::  Exploitation  ::
(  Leveraging what was found in the Vulnerability Analysis  )

[  Countermeasures  ]:    Protection mechanisms --> Anti-virus software,
                          Humans (like being helpful), Data Execution Protection,
                          Address space layout randomization, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

[  Evasion  ]:            Avoiding detection

[  Precision Strike  ]:   Only use exploits most likely to achieve success

[  Customized Exploitation Avenue   ]:  Customizing exploits

[  Tailored Exploits  ]:    These require development work  --> Basically, it might have worked
                            on one machine, model, or system but needs change to work on another

[  Zero-day Angle  ]:    Fuzzing / fault injection, source code analysis
                         (Buffer overflows, structured exception handling or SEH overwrites,
                         and return-oriented programming),  Traffic analysis, etc

[  Example Avenues of Attack  ]:  This is on the website but attempts to explain various avenues of attack.

[  Overall Objective  ]:   How project objectives should be considered when creating exploit path/process




::  Post Exploitation  ::

Rules of Engagement:      Protects you and protects client

Infrastructure Analysis:  Learning system for pivoting and concluding report

Pillaging:                *Not what it sounds like:  Alll about gathering system
                           info such as security, programs installed, configuratuions,
                           security, email, EVERYTHING!!

High Value / Profile Targets

Data Exfil.:  How data can be removed? Finding this out...

Persistence:   Backdoor persistence, credential sniffing, keyloggers, etc.

Pivoting:   Further exploits to other systems

Cleanup:  Remove everything done to system during attack. Config changes, programs, etc.



::  Reporting  ::
Executive summery:
     -- Background
     -- Overall Posture
     -- Risk Ranking / Profile of org.
     -- General Findings
     -- Recommendations Summary
     -- Strategic Roadmap for mitigation

Technical Report:
    -- Introduction:  Outline key facts about the test and results
    -- Information Gathering:  Should describe intel gathered and how. (Active or Passive means?)
    -- Vulnerability Assessment:  Risk-ranked list of potential vulnerabilities discovered
    -- Exploitation:
    -- Post Exploitation: Describes activities that occurred once access was established
    -- Risk: Describes and quantifies risks, vulnerabilities, exploitation, and post exploits
    -- Conclusion: Highlight key finding
