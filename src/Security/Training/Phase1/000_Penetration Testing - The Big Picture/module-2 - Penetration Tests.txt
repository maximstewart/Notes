::    Manual and Automated Testing    ::

--  Manual  --
Require understanding target
Create custom queries and inputs
Configure a tool specifically for the target
Create custom code
Interpret output and results
Consider the internal state and operations


[  Low error rate  ]
    -- Few False Positives
    -- Few False Negatives
[  Level of effort  ]
    -- Exploration: High
    -- Interpretation: High
[  Likelihood of detection  ] == Low


--  Automated  --
Requires a target
Can use default settings
Must review results
Adjust settings
Repeat tests


[  High error rate  ]
    -- More False Positives
    -- More False Negatives
[  Level of effort  ]
    -- Exploration: Low
    -- Interpretation: Medium
[  Likelihood of detection  ] == High




::    Goal-oriented and Time-limited Testing    ::

--  Goal-oriented  --  (  Specific targets; Narrows focus  )

Define goal in contract
Provide proof that goal was achieved
Get access on specific system
Place a fake device in an office
Exfil. a specific type of data


--  Time-limited  --
Cost controlled by client.
Take a comprehensive buyt focused approach
Provide valuable actionable data
Highly targeted due to time frame




::    Network Focused Testing    ::
Attain unauthorized access
Evaluate compromised system
Pivot to the next system
Repeat


--  Org. Network Types
[  Internal Network  ]:   Informational assets exist, stored, processed, managed, and processed.
                          (Physical and virtual network wiring)

[  Wireless Network  ]:   (wireless clients, access points, and management systems)
                          Can act as a perimeter network.

[  Perimeter Network  ]:  Provides access to a portion of a systems network  (eail, web, DNS servers, and VPN)
                          Third party apps and services go here too.




::    Application Focused Testing    ::
Commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)
Internally developed
Third-party developed
Shadow IT  (Unvetted applications that you're not aware of necessarily.
            Printer drivers maybe? NIC drivers? Etc...)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)


[  Outdated Software  ]

[  Misconfiguration  ]

[  Poor design  ]

[  Poor implementation  ]


--  Application Types  --
Enterprise Apps:  org. wide systems such as enterprise resource planning or ERP apps,
                  HR systems, customer relationship management or CRM apps, or file
                  storage and archive systems

Web Sites, Apps, and Services

Mobile Apps:   Sensitive data locally on a device. Easily lost or subject to search.

Thick Clients:  Desktop applications that store data locally or access sensitive data remotely



::    Physical Testing    ::


--  information Gathering  --
[  Dumpster Diving  ]

[  Surveillance  ]
    -- Observation
    -- Photo and Video

[  Satellite Imagery  ]
    -- Ident. perimeters of facility, locations of physical plant and utilities, points of
       surveillance and entry, and for measuring distances around the facility.

[  Open Sources  ]
    -- Client's websites, city, county, and court records, and filings with regulatory agencies.
