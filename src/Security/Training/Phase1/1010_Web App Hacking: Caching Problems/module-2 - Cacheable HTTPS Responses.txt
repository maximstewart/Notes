::  HTTPS Is Not Enough!  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

If https responses are cacheable.
What if password reset is cached and header has the info?
Security is bypassed....




::  Demo  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    about:cache  <-- firefox

HTTPS: secure communication channel

Sensitive data returned in HTTPS response (e.g. password)
                     +
Cacheable HTTPS response (e.g. Cache-control/Pragma headers not implemented)
                     =
Password cached in plaintext




::  Fixing the Problem  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Don't return sensative data in HTTPS responses.
Set proper caching headers like cache control and pragma...

    Cache-control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache
