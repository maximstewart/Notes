Method:
    robots.txt  (Boy aint that the truth. WPScan showed me this. XD)
        Fix:  Setup internal routs and responses.
              Use maybe internal IP as validation for access/VPN?

Explains a scenario where the robots file shows a PHP file and a config file.
PHP gets processed but config returns data b/c it's a non-standard file.
The config file has db creds in plain text...
    Fix: Use PHP file to setup connection since PHP is processed.
         Encrypt the user and password too... <-- This doesn't fix it per-say but makes things harder to exploit.

Directory listing is enabled.
User can access the config path and see the two files.
Thus, can open the config file.
