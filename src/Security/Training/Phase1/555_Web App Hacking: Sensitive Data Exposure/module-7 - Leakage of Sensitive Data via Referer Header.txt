::  Password Reset Link  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Common Link Structures:
    <domain>/reset.php?token=kj5h9gf7ed8rf89tjhg
    "BAD":
        <domain>/reset.php?userID=3451&token=kj5h9gf7ed8rf89tjhg
        Token should be unique to userID and id shouldn't be used.




::  Leakage via Referer Header  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

When browser fetching say an image, it makes a call to the link.
Users password reset link is transferred to external domain
The referer domain leaks the link. But, if it had the ID too
then a hacker could use that too.

Fix: Change the referer domain? Expire reset links in a timly manner...

::  Fixing the Problem  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Host it yourself. At least on the reset link and login links...
