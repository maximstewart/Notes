::  Demo  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Used exif tool on a msword file.
Metadata had comments that gave a link with user and password to a documents archive.

    Fix:  Scrub all metadata out... (But then how are comments preserved?)
          Better internal policy about information transfer.
          Maybe give link but no password n user?
