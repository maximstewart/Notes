::  Understanding a Login CSRF Attack  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

A login CSRF attack is about switching a user to the attacker’s account
By switching them, they enter sensitive information that the attacker can see...
    Through proxying? Through the saved data?




::  Demo  ::
--  Tool(s)  --


User is logged in (example.com)
    V
User visits an attacker’s domain
(hacking-web-applications.com)
    V
Attacker tricks the user’s browser into sending a
login request (with the attacker’s email and password)
    V
The user is switched to the attacker’s account
    V
User enters credit card data to the attacker’s account
