Reflected Attack
    User could be prompted by malicious link.
    Link runs script which pulls all cookies
    and sends to offload site.




::  HttpOnly Attribute  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Prevents JS from having access to the cookie.
The cookie can still be sent via headers.
Still need secure argument for transferring
across only HTTPS




::  Demo  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Shows XSS works
Can send link to victim with malicious search which reflects
a script back to the page. The script tag has a script written that requests
the cookies.

NOTE: This was done through URL parameters
      Session ID was NOT set to httponly!!


Fixes:
    1. Use httponly attribute on sensitive data!
        (This doesn't fix the XSS though! It just prevents certain losses.)
    2. Proper sanitized return data!
        The script got embedded to the page b/c the page
        presents a message of what was queried.
        Do generic responses than taking users input.
        Simpler than worrying about proper sanitation...
