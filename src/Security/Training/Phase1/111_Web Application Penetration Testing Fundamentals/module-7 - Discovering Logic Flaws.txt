::  Beating Limits  ::
min/max checks?
Less than 0?




::  Process Timing  ::
Time of day?
Time to process?
Time limits?

Success vs error processing?




::  Spilling the Secrets  ::
Correlation checks
Does one process decrypt data that another process could use to decrypt other data?




::  Parameter Manipulation  ::
