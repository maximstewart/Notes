::  Authentication  ::

POST over HTTPS:  Ensure can't get to HTTP side

Pretty much covers standard policies such as Lockout policies, password lengths and strength,
whether over https with post (the best correct way) and whether any other (the worst wrong way)

Password reset links should be tokenized and live for 5, 10, to 20 minutes. If still alive past 24 hours it's a finding.
Obviously limit previous password usage to some degree (60 rounds before reuse)

Security question /answer:  Is it limited or infinite in nature?

What is your favorite NBA team?  == about 30 total. Will it let me try all
thirty or lock out and request I call help line?



::  Session  ::
Is the session token meaningful or completely random?? NEVER base64 shit into it!!!
Determine if content encode.

Try generating multiple tokens. See if any repetition.
Create multiple accounts.
Compare tokens against access levels guest/admin


--  Predictability and Randomization  --

Protect in transit
No URL
Expire




::  Access Controls  ::
Insecure direct object reference
NEVER security through obscurity!!
Unprotected API calls
