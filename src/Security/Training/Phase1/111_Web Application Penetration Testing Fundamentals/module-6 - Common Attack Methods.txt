::  Insecure Direct Object Reference  ::
Basically, can I get to the data directly and bypass page logic??




::  Request Forgery  ::
CSRF:  Basically, trying to run command from another "site/location" while user is authenticated in the system.
Instead of being requested from your site and the user directly it can be masked from another site if not checked against
