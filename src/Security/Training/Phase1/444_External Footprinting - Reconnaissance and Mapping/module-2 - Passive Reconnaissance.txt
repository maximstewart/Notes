*** Collecting information about the company without communicating with any of their systems.

[  Challenge  ]:
    --  Tool(s)  --
        Kali Linux

    Start with:
        -- facebook.com
    End with:
        -- +100,000 IPv4
        -- +100 IPv6 Ranges
        -- More than 5k hostnames



::  WHOIS  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    dmitry: Demographic Information Gathering Tool  -- See  module-2-image-1  image
    whois:  Gets the company info
    nslookup:   DNS lookup
    ARIN Site


Is a protocol that translates URL to company information
Go from a URL to list of IP addresses.
Associated anonymous system information (ASN Info)
*** Can use IPs to bypass some information hiding services against WHOIS lookups (see nslookup to get ip/domain)


seed URL:         facebook.com
WHOIS lookups:
                  +100,000 IPv4
                  +100 IPv6 Ranges




::  BGP  ::  (Border Gateway Protocal)
*** Exchanges antonymous system network routing information
    (Ie, creates A PATH BETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS)
    Routing decisions on core internet
*** AS (antonymous system) is associated with network ranges

--  Tool(s)  --
    See  module-2-image-2  image




::  Internet Scanning Projects  ::
*** Internet scanning projects perform TCP and UDP port scans across the entire internet on a daily or weekly basis.
    The data is then made publicly available and the goal is to provide the public with the data for analysis.
    IE, great for gathering info/reconnaissance

--  Tool(s)  --
    scans.io : Hosted and maintained by University of Michigan
               censys.io  allows for interactive querying against data
        Relevant to Footprinting:
            DNSs:              Virtual Hosts
            SSL Certificates:  Subject alternative names (another list of hostnames)
            Live Services
    commoncrawl.org:  crawl of the internet itself. (Kinda like backend of Google)
    www.shodan.io
    crt.sh:  Comodo Certificate sdearch
    pigz:  parallel decompression of tar,gzip files




::  DNS Bruteforcing  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    DNSRecon on Kali:  dnsrecon -d <your domain> -t <types: brt for bruteforce> -n 8.8.8.8 -D <dictionary> -c <store results path file> -f <if dns wildcard in place>
    Fierce on Kali

Advanced Tactics:
    Recursive Bruteforce
    Use organization  specific patterns.
    Ask someone




::  Digging Deep on Third Party Servers  ::
(Think like an attacker)
(Think like an employee)

*** Think of the two sites as philosophy than actual steps.
    Does it make sense to check these basically?

--  Tool(s)  --
    virustotal.com :  Might list domains checked by users. (When OK they are acrtual domains of company)
    threatcrowd.org : Malware threat information


Think about 3rd party services.
Think about mergers and acquisitions.
Think about presentation sharing sites such as slideshare.net or prezi.com
Industry blog posts
Conference videos
