::  Port Scanning  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    Nmap
    Metasploit:  Can "store" data and handle many formats... Postgress SQL as backend


Bad Habits:
Avoid "Kitchen Sink" syndrome! Be precise and DON'T firehose scan everything!
    It's loud and makes for easy detection.
    It's extremely slow.
    Can be greatly misleading given it can be destructive by taking down services.

Good Habits:
    Perform multiple scans
    Slow down service scans and target a few at a time.
    Store scan data effectively


Some common NMAP flags used:  See  module-3-image-1  image
*** Check his notes for common service ports!




::  Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    Nmap Scanning Engine (NSE):
        Supports most Nmap protocols
        Massively parallel
        Kali ships with 515 NSE scripts
    Masscan:
        Scan entire Internet in 6 minutes
    ZMap:
        Perform checks similar to NSE





::  Screenshooting  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    EyeWitness:  A python script to take snapshots
                 python EyeWitness.py --headless -x <scan_list>.xml

Scan results or IP with Nmap and then screenshoot.




::  DNS Bruteforcing  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    dig: DNS requests tool
    dnsrecon: Python script for dns zone transfer checking

In this instance we use company's Domain server instead of 8.8.8.8 or other non related DNS server.
Remember, in passive scan we NEVER touch anything related to company!! In active scanning,
we do touch company servers/services...

Active vs. Passive DNS Bruteforcing:
    See  module-3-image-2  image




::  NTP  ::
(Network Time Protocol)
** Time syncing protocol

--  Tool(s)  --
    Nmap NSE:  ntp-monlist -->  nmap --script ntp-monlist $IP
    NTP tools:  apt-get install ntp


NTPd = daemon

They store devices that have communicated with it.
If missconfigured, while rare, it can expose those addresses and hostenames

Getting IPs from NTP
See  module-3-image-3  image

*** mrulist command in pic is most likely to work but no DoS risk




::  SNMP  ::
(Simple Network Management Protocol)
*** Manages or monitors devices
*** Usually for switches and routers but can have Printers and VOIP Phones over internet

--  Tool(s)  --


Network Monitoring System (NMS) collects information
SNOM agent has the actual info to be collected

Spoofing as NMS to try and collect information about network.

Can reveal:
    Version info, network routing inf, usernames, process IDs, and more

*** If you can modify the device it's an instant critical finding
   Networking device modification would mean changing internet firewall rules
   or, with the right device, permanent compromise of the system.
