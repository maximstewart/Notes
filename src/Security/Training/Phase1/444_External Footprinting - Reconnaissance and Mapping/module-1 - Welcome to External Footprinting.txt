Virtual Hosts:  Multiple domain names map to single IP. Valuable in that when
                one app is insecure it can undermine the other apps security

*** When looking for domain names, it's really common to find copied development
    versions of a website on the internet.
Ex:  staging.customer.com  (most common target b/c of less defenses.)
     dev.customer.com
     dev2.customer.com

Note:  Defense might be to map against external vs internal IP. IE, using company or VPN IP
