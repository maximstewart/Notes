*** Drilling down in prioritized service list



::  Banner Grabbing  ::
*** tend to get best results with internal assessments.

--  Tool(s)  --

Automate connections to the servers and scope and pull back the response banner.
Can sometimes pull back MySQL banner which could give version info.




::  Hunting Weak Web Applications  ::
--  Tool(s)  --
    Nmap:  http-enums script (has big dictionary of common pages)
           *** Look for things like phpMyAdmin pages
           Can pickup Wordpress versions
    whatweb: good plugins
            Can find interesting headers
    wpscan:  Wordpress scan
            Enumerate users and plugins



Look for OTS (Off the Shelf) software
Pre-packaged install
Supports plugins
Open source vs. Vendor specific (Enterprise)...
Custom developed pages

Talk with customer about patching cycle. Is it under 2 hours?
Look to Drupal case study where vulnerability left all instances
not patched within 7 hours as infected.




::  SMTP Bounceback  ::
*** Sends email to non-existent addess to target email server
    Target sends a bounceback stating address doesn't exist. (DoS/DDoS threat too?)
    can view details from the response for useful information

*** Limited effect but can be useful.

--  Tool(s)  --




::  SMTP Enumeration  ::
*** Can get enterprise or domain accounts

--  Tool(s)  --

SMTP User Enumeration:
    See  module-4-image-1  image

Can use Metasploit module smtp_enum, included with Kali to automate this process

Defences:
    White listing, reputation of connecting IPs, disallowing multiple
    receipt-to attempts and SPF or its counterpart DKIM, which are aimed at preventing spoofed email.




::  Username Enumeration - Error Messaging  ::
*** Basically, see what error messages give. Does username or password not exist?

--  Tool(s)  --


Account Lockouts:
    Lockout threshold and timeout
    Lack of lockout is/really/bad

Single password bruteforce

Case Study:
    See  module-4-image-2  image




::  Username Enumeration - Timing Attacks  ::
--  Tool(s)  --

Timing Attack Baseline:
