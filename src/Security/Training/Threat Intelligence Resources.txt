Cyber-attacks become less effective when they are well-known, so new threats and exploits appear all the time.
To keep up to date, you should monitor websites and newsgroups.
Some examples of threat intelligence feed providers and sources for threat reports, alerts, and newsletters include:

    Alien Vault (https://www.alienvault.com/solutions/threat-intelligence)
    SecureWorks (https://www.secureworks.com/capabilities/counter-threat-unit)
    FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html)
    Symantec (http://symantec.com/security-intelligence)
    Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi)
    DarkReading (https://www.darkreading.com)
    SANS (https://www.sans.org/newsletters)



Metagoofil  --  Application that scans meta information about a network.





Packet Injection

Some attacks depend on sending forged or spoofed network traffic. Often network sniffing software libraries allow
frames to be inserted (or injected) into the network stream. There are also tools that allow for different kinds
of packets to be crafted and manipulated. Well-known tools used for packet injection include Dsniff (https://monkey
org/~dugsong/dsniff/), Ettercap (http://www.ettercap-project.org/ettercap), hping (http://hping.org),
Nemesis (http://nemesis.sourceforge.net), and Scapy (http://scapy.net/).




Vulnerability Scanner Types

A vulnerability scanner can be implemented purely as software or as a security appliance, connected to the network.
One of the best known software scanners is Tenable Nessus (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional).
As a previously open source program, Nessus also provides the source code for many other scanners.
Greenbone OpenVAS (http://www.openvas.org) is open source software, originally developed from the Nessus codebase at the
point where Nessus became commercial software. It is available in a Community Edition VM, as an enterprise product called
Greenbone Security Manager (https://www.greenbone.net), and as source code or pre-compiled packages for installation under
Linux. Some other vulnerability scanners include SAINT (https://www.saintcorporation.com/security-suite),
BeyondTrust Retina (https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/datasheets/retina-network-security-scanner), and
Rapid7 NeXpose (https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose).

Another class of scanner aims to identify web application vulnerabilities specifically. Tools such as
Nikto (https://cirt.net/Nikto2) look for known software exploits, such as SQL injection and XSS, and may also analyze source code
and database security to detect unsecure programming practices.




The best-known exploit framework is Metasploit (https://www.metasploit.com). The platform is open source software, now maintained
by Rapid7. There is a free framework (command-line) community edition with installation packages for Linux and Windows.
Rapid7 produces pro and express commercial editions of the framework and it can be closely integrated with the Nexpose vulnerability scanner.
