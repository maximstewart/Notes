>&#13;     Clearly without source code, we can't possibly hope to understand all
     of sections of an entire program. So we have to use various methods and
     guess work to narrow down our search to a couple of key functions.

>&#13;       The problem is that first, we must determine what portions of the code
       are actually functions. This can be difficult without debugging dymbols.
       Fortunately, there are a couple of utilities that make our lives easier.

><P
>Objdump's most useful purpose is to disassemble a program with the -d
         switch. Lacking symbols, this output is a bit more cryptic. The -j option
         is used to specify a segment to disassemble. Most likely we will want
         .text, which is where all the program code lies.
	</P

>Note that the leftmost column of objdump contains a hex number. This
         is in fact the actual address in memory where that
         instruction is located. Its binary value is given in the next column, followed by
         its mnemonic.

	 event that symbols are not included. The script has since been extended and 
	 improved by myself and Nasko Oskov. It now makes 3 passes through the output. 
	 The first pass builds a symbol table of called and jumped-to locations. 
	 The second pass finds areas between two rets, and inserts them into the symbol 
	 table as "unused" functions. The third pass prints out the nicely labeled 
	 output, and prints out a function call tree. Usage:

>&#13;       Ok, so now we're getting ready to get really down and dirty. The first
       step to finding what you are looking for is to know what you are
       looking for. Which functions are 'interesting' is entirely dependent on your point
       of view. Are you looking for copy protection? How do you suspect it is
       done. When in the program execution does it show up? Are you looking
       to do a security audit of the program? Is there any sloppy string usage?
       Which functions use strcmp, sprintf, etc? Which use malloc? Is there a
       possibility of improper memory allocation?

>&#13;         Regardless of our objective, it is almost always helpful to know where
         main() lies. Unforuntely, when debugging symbols are removed, this is
         not always easy.

>&#13;         In Linux, program execution actually begins at the location defined by
         the _start symbol, which is provided by gcc in the crt0 libraries (check
         gcc -v for location). Execution then continues to __libc_start_main(),
         which calls _init() for each library in the program space. Each _init() then
         calls any global constructors you may
         have in that particular library. Global constructors can be created by
         making global instances of C++
         classes with a constructor, or by specifying
         __attribute__((constructor)) after a function prototype. After this,
         execution is finally transferred to main.
        </P
><P
>&#13;         The easiest technique is to try to use our friends ltrace and gdb
         together with our disassembled output. Checking the return address of
         the first few functions of ltrace -i, and cross refrencing that to our
         assembly output and function call tree should give us a pretty good idea
         where main is. We may have to try to trick the program into exiting
         early, or printout out an error message before it gets too deep into its
         call stack.
        </P
><P
>&#13;         Other techniques exist. For example, we can LD_PRELOAD a <A
HREF="code/constructor.c"
TARGET="_top"
> .c file </A
> with a 
         constructor function in it. We can then set a breakpoint to a libc
         function that it calls that is also in the main executable, and
         <TT
CLASS="function"
>finish</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="function"
>stepi</TT
> 
	 until we are satisfied that we have found main.
        </P
><P
>&#13;	 Even better, we could just set a breakpoint in the function
	 __libc_start_main (which is a libc function, and thus we will always
	 have a symbol for it), and do the same technique of finishing and
	 stepiing until we reach what looks like main to us.
	</P
><P
>&#13;         At worst, even without a frame pointer, we should be able to get the
         address of a function early enough in the execution chain for us to
         consider it to be main.

> Checking the string references to find out which
           functions reference strings that we are interested in.  For
           example, if a program outputs the text "Already registered."
           knowing what function outputs this string is helpful in figuring
           out the protection this particular program uses.

>Running a program in gdb, then hitting control C when it begins
           to perform some interesting operation. using stepi N should slow things
           down and allow you to be more accurate. Sometimes this is too slow
           however. Find a commonly called function, set a breakpoint, and try
           doing cont N.</P

><P
>&#13;       Plot out execution paths into a tree from main, especially to your
       function(s) of interest. You can use disasm.pl to generate call graphs
		with the --graph option. Using it enables the script to generate file
		called call_graph. It contains definition of the call graph in a
		format used by a popular graphing tool called dot. Feeding this
		definition file in dot will give you a nice (probably pretty huge)
		graphics file with visual representation of the call graph. It is
		pretty amazing. Definitely try it with some small program.
